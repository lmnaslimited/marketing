Published way back in 1966, Drucker's advice for executives holds true today. It’ll help a busy person accomplish more at work either as an executive or manager. The book also covers how to manage upward and master effective delegation.

Expect gems like, “Unless commitment is made, there are only promises and hopes; but no plans,” and, “Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.”

This classic business book also pairs nicely with Drucker's much shorter book published by Harvard Business Review Classics in 2008, titled Managing Oneself.
