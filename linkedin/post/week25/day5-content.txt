To be honest, any Jim Collins title belongs in a list like this. He excels at profiling large companies and the decision-makers behind them.  

Some of the companies profiled in his older book From Good to Great (2001) have since disappeared, making this title more relevant today. If you're serious about running a larger business, Collins’s books are required reading. 

Expect gems like, “When you marry operating excellence with innovation, you multiply the value of your creativity.”
