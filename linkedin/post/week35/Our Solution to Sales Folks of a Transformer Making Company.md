The operations manager used to have long Tuesdays as he has to submit the weekly sales-pipeline, order-backlog and other budgetary reports to his senior executives.
Different quotes from different sales person for the same Tender leading to disputes as there is no central CRM system.
 - The company has invested in one of the major ERP system to handle their  core manufacturing process. However the current ERP system is not providing a comprehensive solution to handle Pre-Sales and Sales. 
 - Pre-Sales, Sales and Finance team are still operating in excels and other manual ways to handle their sales pipeline.
 - Planning and Budgeting is a tedious task as Finance team need to manually feed the Pre-Sales and Sales forecasted revenue and targets in the current ERP system for auditing. 
 - Quoting to customer becomes extremely difficult for the Sales personal as they don't have system to compute breakups on the material, labour and other costs to arrive at the profit margins.
